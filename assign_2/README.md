## Assignment 2

Basic Prefix search and find.

# To use: 

* Open [trie.html](./trie.html) in a browser.
* Select A language to use. (Loads Dictionary asynchronously so may take a second to compile)
* Type word prefix in box, tab complete replaces word with the first found matching in the dictionary.
* Have fun!

## Implementation.
### Data structure
I used a [Trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) to efficiently place the words in a searchable fashion.

### MVC
The MVC used is a small prototype called Ångström. Named after the Swedish Scientist, [Anders Jonas Ångström](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Jonas_%C3%85ngstr%C3%B6m),
the namesake of a microscopic unit of length.
It is inteded to be microscopic in scale compared to current MVC frameworks and leightweight on processing, hence the name.
